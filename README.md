# OpenCourse Backend

OpenCourse Backend is the robust and scalable server-side component of the OpenCourse platform. It's built with modern technologies to handle user authentication, course management, and data storage. This backend system serves as the foundation for the OpenCourse web application, allowing users to create, enroll in, and manage courses effortlessly.

- **Logging**: Employs Winston Logger to maintain detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.

- **Git Hooks**: Uses Husky for Git hooks to enforce code quality and consistency.

- **Serverless Deployment**: Deployable on cloud platforms like AWS Lambda, making it highly scalable and cost-effective.

## Technologies Used

OpenCourse Backend leverages a stack of powerful technologies:

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for building robust and efficient APIs.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type-safe code and improved development experience.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for flexible and scalable data storage.

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for MongoDB object modeling and data validation.

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for serverless architecture and cost-effective scaling.

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for enforcing Git hooks to maintain code quality.

- [Winston Logger](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for comprehensive logging and monitoring.

- [Zeet](https://zeet.co/) for serverless deployment and hosting.
